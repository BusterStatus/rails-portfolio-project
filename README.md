# Case Manager on Rails

Case Manager on Rails is my Rails portfolio project for the Flatiron School online curriculum and now includes JavaScript functionality to improve load times for the caseloads and new clients.  Case Manager allows users to register and sign in and create, read, update, and delete a variety of models, including clients, notes, and caseloads.
