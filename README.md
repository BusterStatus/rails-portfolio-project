The application allows case managers to maintain caseloads and write notes for the individuals they serve.  The app includes avaScript functionality to improve load times for the caseloads and new clients pages.  Case Manager on Rails allows users to register and sign in and create, read, update, and delete a variety of models, including clients, notes, and caseloads.
