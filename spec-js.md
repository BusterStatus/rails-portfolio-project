# Rails App with JavaScript Frontend Spec

Project Specs:
- [x] Must have a Rails Backend and new requirements implemented through JavaScript.  Used existing Case Manager on Rails app from previous project.
- [x] Make use of ES6 features as much as possible (e.g. arrow functions, `let` & `const`, constructor functions).
- [x] Must translate the JSON responses into Javascript Model Objects using either ES6 class or constructor function syntax.  Used constructor functions for caseloads and clients.
- [x] Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.  Render caseloads index.
- [x] Must render at least one show page (show resource - 'one specific thing') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.  Each link on caseloads index renders caseload show.
- [x] Your Rails application must return at least one serialized `has-many` relationship through JSON that is then rendered to the page.  A caseload has many clients; the clients are listed on the caseload show page.
- [x] Must use your Rails application to render a form for creating a resource that is submitted dynamically through JavaScript, using a JSON response of the newly created resource to render to the DOM without a page refresh.  New client form renders the new client without refresh after submission.
- [x] At least one of the JS Model Objects must have a method on the prototype.  Caseload has two prototype methods and client has one.
