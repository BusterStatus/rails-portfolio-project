- [ ] Your Rails application must return at least one serialized `has-many` relationship through JSON that is then rendered to the page.
- [ ] Must use your Rails application to render a form for creating a resource that is submitted dynamically through JavaScript, using a JSON response of the newly created resource to render to the DOM without a page refresh.
- [ ] At least one of the JS Model Objects must have a method on the prototype.
