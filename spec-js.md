# Rails App with JavaScript Frontend Spec

Project Specs:
- [x] Must have a Rails Backend and new requirements implemented through JavaScript.
- [ ] Make use of ES6 features as much as possible (e.g. arrow functions, `let` & `const`, constructor functions).
- [ ] Must translate the JSON responses into Javascript Model Objects using either ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
- [ ] Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.  A list of all caseloads.
- [ ] Must render at least one show page (show resource - 'one specific thing') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend.  From index of caseloads, click on a specific caseload.
- [ ] Your Rails application must return at least one serialized `has-many` relationship through JSON that is then rendered to the page.  Caseload has many clients.
- [ ] Must use your Rails application to render a form for creating a resource that is submitted dynamically through JavaScript, using a JSON response of the newly created resource to render to the DOM without a page refresh.  Form for new client; navigate to new form normally and hijack submit using AJAX.
- [ ] At least one of the JS Model Objects must have a method on the prototype.

Constructor for caseloads and clients.
Remove turbo links from entire project; interferes with DOM manipulation.
